\v 3 Then the angel who had been talking to me started to leave, and another angel walked toward him.
\v 4 The second angel said to him, "Run and tell that young man with the surveyor's line: some day there will be very many people and livestock in Jerusalem, so they will not all be able to live inside the city walls; many will live outside the walls in the open country.
\v 5 Yahweh says that he himself will be like a wall of fire around the city, and he will be among the people with his glory."
