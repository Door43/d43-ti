“Wisdom” uses parallelism to emphasize what she is saying. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:parallelism]])

    * **The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom
and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding** Learning about God increases wisdom. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:parallelism]])

and years added to your life** Your life will become longer. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:parallelism]])
