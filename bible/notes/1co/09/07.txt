===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 No soldiers serves in the army at his own expense. No one plants a vineyard without being able to eat the grapes or drink the wine. No one shepherds a flock and without drinking some of the milk that comes from the animals.

\p
\v 8 This is common sense. But the Law says this as well.

\v 7 Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink milk from it ?
\v 8 Do I say these things based on human authority? Does not the law also say this?
