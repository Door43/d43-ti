\v 12 Since other people \add who preached to you\add* had that right, certainly Barnabas and I have the same right.\f + \ft Or: do Barnabas and I not have the same right? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*
\p However, neither of us insisted \add that you give us the things that\add* we have a right \add to receive from you\add*. Instead, we were willing to endure anything in order that we not hinder \add anyone from believing\add* the message about Christ.
\v 13 You should keep in mind that \add the priests and servants\add* in the Temple eat \add some of the food that people bring to\add* the Temple.\f + \ft Or: Do you not know that \add the priests and servants\add* in the Temple eat \add some of the food that people bring to\add* the Temple? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* Specifically, the priests who work at the altar eat some of \add the food that the people bring to sacrifice on\add* the altar.
\v 14 So the Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the good message \add about him\add* should receive from \add those who hear that\add* message what they need to live on.

\v 12 If others received this kind of help from you, we have certainly proven that we deserve it even more. 
\p However, we have not accepted anything from you, even though we were entitled to it. Instead, we endure all kinds of hardships so that we do not make it more difficult for people to believe in the good news about Christ.
\v 13 Certainly you know that those who helped carry out the sacrifices offered to God in the temple received some of those offerings for their own needs. They received some of the food offered to God.
\v 14 In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the good news are to receive their living wages from the good news. They receive part of what is given to God for their needs.

\v 12 If others exercised this right from you, do we not have even more? Nevertheless, we did not claim this right, but we endured everything rather than be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ.
\v 13 Do you not know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?
\v 14 Even so the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living from the gospel.
