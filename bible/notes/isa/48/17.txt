===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Holy One of Israel** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:isa:01:04|1:4]].
    * **who leads you by the way that you should go** - This refers to the direction given by Yahweh to the people and leads them on the things they should do. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **Then your peace and prosperity would have flowed like a river, and your salvation like the waves of the sea** - This is comparing the images of the rivers that flow gently and the waves that do not cease to what their lives could have been if they had obeyed Yahweh's commandments. Their lives could have been peaceful and successful. This is also saying the same thing twice for emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
