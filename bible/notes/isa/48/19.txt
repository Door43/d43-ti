    * **Your descendants would have been as numerous as the sand, and the children from your womb as numerous as the grains of sand** - Yahweh compares their descendants to grains of sand which was plenty in their land. They could have had numerous descendants and given birth to children as numerous as the sand. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **their name would not have been cut off** - "Name" is used as a short for for the "Country of Israel." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
