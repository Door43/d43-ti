\v 9 Enjoy living with your wife whom you love, all during the time that God has given to you to be alive here on this earth. And even though it is difficult to understand why many things happen, enjoy doing the work that you do here on this earth.
\v 10 Whatever you are able to do, do it with all your energy, because \add some time you will die\add*, and in the place of the dead where you are going, no one works or plans to do anything or knows anything or has any wisdom.

<usfm>
\v 9 Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your life of futility, which God has given you under the sun during your days of futility. That is your reward in life and your work of labor under the sun.
\v 10 Whatever your hand finds to do, work at it with your strength, because there is no work or explanation or knowledge or wisdom in the grave, where  you are going.
