<usfm>
\v 7 Then I returned to see more vanishing vapor under the sun.
\q1 
\v 8 There is the man who is alone. 
\q2 He does not have anyone, no son or brother. 
\q1 There is no end to all his work, 
\q2 yet his eyes are not satisfied with wealth. 
\q1 He wonders, "For whom am I toiling 
\q2 and depriving myself of pleasure?" 
\q1 This also is vapor, an empty burden.
