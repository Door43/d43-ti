<usfm>
\v 3 Someone might have a hundred children and live for many years. But if he is not able to enjoy the things that he has acquired, and if he is not buried \add properly after he dies\add*, \add I say that\add* a child that is dead when it is born is more fortunate.
\v 4 That dead baby's birth is meaningless; it does not even have a name. It goes directly to the place where there is only darkness.

\v 4 That dead baby's birth is meaningless. It does not even have a name. Its brief life becomes only a sad memory.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with good and he is not buried with respect, then I say that a baby born dead is better off than he is.
\v 4 Such a child is born in futility and passes away in darkness, and its name is hidden.
