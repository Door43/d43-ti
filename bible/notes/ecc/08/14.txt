<usfm>
\v 14 Another thing that \add sometimes\add* happens on this earth is that bad things happen to righteous people, and good things happen to evil people. It is difficult to understand why that happens.
\v 15 So I decided that I would recommend that people be happy while they are alive, because the best thing that people can do here on this earth is to eat and drink and be happy. Enjoying doing those things will help people while they do their work, all the days that God has given to them to remain alive here on the earth.

\v 14 There is another futile vapor which is done on the earth. Things happen to the  righteous like happen to the wicked, and things happen to the wicked like happen to the righteous. I say that this also is futile vapor.
\v 15 So I recommend happiness, because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and drink and to be happy, because that will accompany with him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.
