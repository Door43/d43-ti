===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer is describing the "sea", a large tank that Huram made.

    * **The sea stood on twelve oxen** - The sea refers to a large metal/bronze tank to hold water.
    * **stood on** - "was on top of"
    * **twelve oxen** - The oxen were not real animals.  Huram made the oxen of bronze. The previous verses describe things Huram made of bronze, and the descriptions continue here. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]) AT: "twelve bronze statues of oxen" (UDB) 
    * **The sea was set on top of them** - The word "them" refers to the bronze oxen.
    * **The sea was set on top of them** - The fact that the sea was set or put on top of something tells us that someone put it there. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]] and  [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) AT: Huram's "helpers put the bronze tank on the backs of the statues of the oxen." (UDB)
    * **as thick as** - (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **brim** - top edge of a vessel or container
    * **forge/forged** - This means that metal is heated in a fire or a furnace and while it is still hot and soft, someone hammers or beats it into the desired shape.
    * **its brim was forged like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom** - The brim of the sea is compared to the brim of a cup or to the shape of a lily blossom. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) 
    * **like a lily blossom** - AT: "It curved outward like the petals of a lily." (UDB)
    * **bath** - (See: [[:ti:obe:other:biblicalvolume]])
