===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer describes the bronze carts that Huram made.

    * **stands** - Some translations note that these stands were movable and had wheels, so you can also refer to the stands as carts. (See UDB)
    * **cubit** - (See:[[en:obe:other:biblicaldistance]])
    * **The work of the stands was like this** - This means the author will describe the stands in the following or next verses.
    * **They had panels** - Here "they" refers to the stands.
    * **They had panels that stood between frames** - AT: "On the sides of the stands there were panels set in frames." (UDB)
    * **on the panels and on the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim.** - AT: The workers decorated the panels and frames with figures of lions, bulls and cherubim.
    * **Above and below the lions and oxen were wreaths of hammered work.** - Here hammered suggests that workers hammered or beat metal into wreath designs and put the wreath decorations above and below the lions and oxen. Apparently the wreaths were not put above or below the cherubim. AT: "The workers made decorations of wreaths and put them above and below the figures of lions and oxen."
