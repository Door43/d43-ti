===== Translation Notes: =====

The author continues to list items for the temple that were made of bronze.

    * **He made the** - Since the summary list of things Huram made continues here, you can leave out these words. You may leave it if you want to start a new sentence.   
    * **four hundred** - or 400. Decide how you want to translate numbers. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
    * **pomegranate** - a fruit with a hard rind and many juicy seeds inside. The children of Israel missed eating this fruit when they were in the wilderness after leaving Egypt, (Numbers 20:5) and looked forward to eating it again in the place where they were going (Deut 8:8). It was likely a symbol of prosperity. In this verse, it is a bronze decoration that looks like a pomegranate. See how you translated this in 1Ki 7:20
    * **latticework** - a network of interwoven strips of wood, metal or other material. The term suggests a woven pattern of crossed wooden or metal strips, in this case, bronze strips. See how you translated "checker latticework" for verse 17.
    * **decorative latticework:** - Here the colon (:) indicates that a description of the latticework will follow.
    * **and the ten stands** - If you are continuing the list, you may leave out the word "and" in this phrase for verse 43. See how you proceeded in verse 41 and decide how you want to continue. 
    * **stands** - Some translations note that the stands were movable and had wheels, so you can also refer to the stands as carts. (See how you translated stand in 1Ki 7:27, 32, 34, 37, 38, 39)
    * **verses 42-43** - Using semicolons (;) will help clarify and separate descriptions from the listed items after the colon (:). AT: "the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of decorative latticework: two rows of pomegranates for each set of latticework to cover the two bowl like capitals that were on the pillars; the ten stands and the ten basins on the stands;"
