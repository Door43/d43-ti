===== Translation Notes: =====

The author writes about the 2 pillars, named Jakin and Boaz.

    * **capital** - In this verse, capital refers to a decoration on top of the column or pillar.
    * **two hundred** - or 200. Decide how you want to translate numbers. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
    * **pomegranate** - a fruit with a hard rind and many juicy seeds inside. The children of Israel missed eating this fruit when they were in the wilderness after leaving Egypt, (Numbers 20:5) and looked forward to eating it again in the place where they were going (Deut 8:8). It was likely a symbol of prosperity. In this verse, it is a bronze decoration that looks like a pomegranate.
    * **He raised up the pillars** - The word "He" refers to Huram and his workers. Huram could not have raised up these large pillars by himself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]]) 
    * **He raised up the pillars at the temple portico.** - "raised up the pillars" means the workers lifted the pillars and stood them up. It is implicit that the pillars were cast or made on the ground, and after Huram and his workers finished making them, they lifted the pillars and stood them up in front of the temple portico. (See [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
   * **portico** - a covered structure or porch, supported by pillars and attached to the front entrance of a building [also used in 1 Kings 7:6 and 7:12]
    * **The pillar on the right hand was named Jakin, and the pillar on the left hand was named Boaz.** - There is a lot of discussion about the names of the pillars. It is suggested that priests were annointed at the Jakin pillar and kings were annointed at the Boaz pillar (2Kings 11:14). Since the temple entrance faced east, Jakin, the pillar on the right hand, was on the south side, and Boaz, the pillar on the left hand, was on the north side. 
    * **Jakin** - The name Jakin, also spelled Jachin, means God establishes. Ja or Yah from Yahweh, is God's name, and kin, also chin or cun, means establishes.
    * **Boaz** - Boaz was the great-great-grandfather of Solomon. 
    * **On the top of the pillars were decorations like lilies.** - AT: "These tops were placed on a bowl shaped section" (UDB).
    * **lily/lilies** - a trumpet-shaped flower. In this verse lilies are bronze decorations that look like this flower. They were likely bowl or globe shaped, one on top of each pillar, as the Hebrew terms gullot (plural) and gullah (singular) indicate [1 Kings 7:41 and Zech 4:2].
