\v 1 During the twentieth year after King Artaxerxes \add began to rule the Persian Empire\add*, during the spring\f + \ft Or: before the hot season \f* of that year, when it was time to serve wine to him \add during a feast\add*, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never looked sad when I was in front of him before, \add but on that day he saw that I looked very sad\add*.
\v 2 So he asked me, "Why are you sad? \add I know that\add* you are not sick. It must be that you are sad in your inner being." Then I was very afraid, \add because it was not proper to be sad when I came to the king\add* \f + \ft Or: \add because I was worried what the king would do to me if he refused to do what I was about to request him to do\add* \f*.

\v 1 In the month of Nisan during the twentieth year of the rule of King Artaxerxes, it was time to serve wine to him during a feast. I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never looked sad when I was before the king.
\v 2 But that day, the king looked at me and he said to me, "Why are you so sad? You do not look sick. Perhaps your spirit is troubled?" Then I was very afraid.

\v 1 In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, he selected wine, and I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never before been sad in his presence.
\v 2 But the king said to me, "Why is your face so sad? You do not appear to be ill. This must be sadness of heart." Then I became very much afraid.
