\v 4 The king replied, "What do you want me to do for you?"
\p And before I answered him, I prayed to God in heaven.
\v 5 Then I replied, "If you are willing to do it, and if I have pleased you, then you could send me to Jerusalem, where my ancestors are buried, so that I may rebuild the city."
\p
\v 6  The king (with queen sitting beside him) asked me, "If I allow you to go, how long will you be gone? And when will you return?" He gave me permisson to go as soon as I gave him the dates of my going there and coming back again.

\v 4 Then the king said to me, "What do you want me to do?" So I prayed to the God of heaven.
\v 5 I replied to the king, "If it seems good to the king, and if your servant has done well in your sight, you could send me to Judah, to the city of my fathersâ€™ tombs, that I may rebuild it.
\v 6 The king replied to me (and the queen was also sitting beside him), "How long shall you be away and when will you return?"
The king was glad to send me when I gave him the dates.
