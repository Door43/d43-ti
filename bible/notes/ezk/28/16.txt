\v 16 Then you became busy buying and selling things,
\q2 and you started to act violently,
\q2 and you sinned.
\q1 So I caused you to be disgraced;
\q2 and the angel who was guarding you forced you to leave my holy mountain,
\q2 forced you to leave your place among those fiery stones.
\q1
\v 17 You were extremely proud
\q2 because you were very handsome.
\q1 Because you loved beautiful things,
\q2 you did things that wise people do not do.
\q1 So I threw you to the ground,
