<usfm>
\v 19 This is also what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: 'When I cause the city of Tyre to become desolate\f + \ft Or: empty \f*, like other cities in which people no longer live, and when I cause the huge waves of the sea to cover it,
\v 20 then I will bring the people of that city down to be with those who have gone down to where the dead people are, people who lived long ago. I will cause them to live in the place below the earth that is like old\f + \ft Or: ancient \f* ruins, with those who have gone down to that pit previously, and they will never return to the earth, to where people are alive.
\v 21 I will cause them to die in a horrible way \f + \ft Or: people will be very afraid because of what happens to that city \f*, and that will be the end of them\f + \ft Or: their lives \f*. People will search for that city but it will no longer exist. That is what I, Yahweh the Lord, declare \add will happen\add*.'~"

<usfm>
\v 19 This is also what the Lord Yahweh says: 'When I cause everyone to leave the city of Tyre, like people have left other cities in which no one lives any longer, and when I cause the huge waves of the sea to cover the city,
\v 20 then I will bring the people of that city down to be with everyone else who is dead, those who died long ago. I will cause them to live in the place below the earth that is like old ruins, with those who have gone down to that pit previously, and they will never return to the earth, to where people are alive.
\v 21 I will cause them to die in a horrible way, and that will be the end of them. People will search for that city, but it will no longer exist." This is what the Lord Yahweh declares will happen.

\v 19 For the Lord Yahweh says this: When I make you a desolate city, like the other cities that are not inhabited, when I raise up the deeps against you, and when the great waters cover you,
\v 20 then I will bring you down to the people of ancient times, like the others who have gone down into the pit; for I will make you live in the lowest realms of the earth as in ruins of ancient times. Because of this you will not come back to the land where people live.
\v 21 I will place disaster on you, and you will exist no more. Then you will be sought, but you will never be found ever again." This is the Lord Yahwehâ€™s declaration!
