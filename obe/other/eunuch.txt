====== eunuch ======

===== Definition: =====

Literally, a "eunuch" is a man who does not have functioning sex organs. The term later became a general term to refer to any government official, even those without the deformity.

  * Often a eunuch was a man who had been castrated.
  * Sometimes a man was a eunuch because he was born with damaged sex organs.
  * In ancient times, eunuchs were often kings' servants who were set as guards over the women's quarters (as in the story of Esther).
  * Some eunuchs were important government officials, as is probable in the New Testament account of the Ethiopian eunuch that Philip encountered.
